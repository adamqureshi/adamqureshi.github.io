the game is changing.

with ai, one person can launch and earn with **150 paying customers**. that’s enough to live, learn, and keep going.

**the simple plan**
- copy a big problem. serve a small group.
- build with ai tools. ship the basics first.
- make one clear promise. one clear action. one clear price.
- don’t make users think. shorten forms. fewer clicks. fast answers.

**money math**
- 150 × $50/mo = **$7,500 MRR**
- 150 × $99/mo = **$14,850 MRR**

**how to start**
1) pick a niche you understand.  
2) write the promise: “i help **[who]** get **[result]** without **[pain]**.”  
3) pre-sell to 5–10 people. collect feedback.  
4) ship week-1 mvp. talk to users daily.  
5) improve 1% every day. raise price after the first 10 wins.

small ideas can feed you. small teams can move faster. small products can win.

stay small. stay alive.
