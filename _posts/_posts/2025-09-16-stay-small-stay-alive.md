the game is changing.

with ai, one person can launch and earn with **150 paying customers**. that’s enough to live, learn, and keep going.

**the simple plan**
- copy a big problem. serve a small group.
- build with ai tools. ship the basics first.
- one clear promise. one clear action. one clear price.
- don’t make users think. fewer clicks. fast answers.

**money math**
- 150 × $50/mo = **$7,500 MRR**
- 150 × $99/mo = **$14,850 MRR**

stay small. stay alive.
