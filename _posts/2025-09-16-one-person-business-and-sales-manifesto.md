1) i’m small on purpose. that’s my edge.  
2) i ship fast, talk straight, and own my misses.  
3) i sell by helping, not by hyping.  
4) i don’t chase everyone; i serve the right someone.  
5) price is a promise—i earn it in outcomes, not adjectives.  
6) follow-up beats fancy funnels. every time.  
7) if the customer wins, i win. if not, the deal wasn’t done.  
8) i automate the boring so i can human the important.  
9) i measure, learn, and make it 1% better daily.  
10) i won’t be the cheapest; i will be the most useful.  
11) competitors are teachers; the market is feedback.  
12) i protect cash like oxygen and spend on what compounds.  
13) i tell the truth even when it costs me.  
14) i play the long game.

**my promise:** i help **[who]** get **[result]** without **[pain]**.  
**my sales rule:** every convo gives **[one clear next step]**.  
**my edge:** i beat big by **[speed / care / niche focus]**.
