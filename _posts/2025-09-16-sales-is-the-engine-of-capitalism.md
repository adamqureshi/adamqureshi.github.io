sales is the engine of capitalism. no sales, no oxygen.  
if you can make sales, you survive.

ai changes the game. one person can ship **tiny apps** that fix one small pain for one small group—and get paid.

it used to be “software is eating the world.”  
now it’s **ai is eating the world**.  
every company becomes an ai company.

**use ai before ai uses you.**

**simple playbook**
- pick a clear pain.
- make **one promise** and **one call to action**.
- build the smallest thing that proves the promise (use ai tools).
- talk to 20 people. ask for the card. improve fast.

sell the outcome, not the features. ship small. iterate daily.
